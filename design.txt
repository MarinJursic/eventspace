Figma design requirements:

Task D1: Create Presentation (.pdf/.mp4):
Define the Concept: Clearly state what EventSpace is, who it's for (customers, vendors), and why it's needed (the problem it solves).
Develop User Personas: Create detailed representations of your target customer(s) and vendor(s).
Establish Visual Guidelines:
Design a Logo.
Define a Color Palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, status colors - ensure consistency with tailwind.config.ts).
Choose Typography (ensure consistency with tailwind.config.ts and globals.css). Define font families, sizes, weights for headings, body text, buttons, etc.
Select or design an Icon Set (Leverage Lucide, but ensure consistency).
Task D2: Create Figma Prototip (.fig file & link):
Design at least 5 key screens (e.g., Homepage, Venue Listing, Venue Detail, Booking Cart, User Dashboard).
Ensure screens are interconnected and clickable to demonstrate user flow.
Apply the visual guidelines defined in D1.
Task D3: UI Refinement (Implementation):
Review all existing pages and components (/app, /components).
Ensure consistent application of the defined color palette, typography, and iconography (from D1).
Improve layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy based on the Figma prototype (D2).
Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Refine the look and feel of Shadcn components to match the brand identity if needed.
Task D4: UX Refinement & Testing:
Map out key user flows (e.g., finding & booking a venue, vendor listing creation, admin approval).
Test these flows using the prototype (D2) and the actual application.
Identify and fix usability issues (confusing navigation, unclear buttons, difficult forms).
Optimize loading states (use skeletons, spinners consistently).
Improve feedback mechanisms (e.g., better toast messages, form validation feedback).
Ensure navigation is intuitive (Navbar, Sidebars, Breadcrumbs).
